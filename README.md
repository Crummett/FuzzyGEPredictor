# FuzzyGEPredictor

An attempt to predict UK general elections with fuzzy analysis powered by the fuzzylite library (https://github.com/fuzzylite/fuzzylite)

Fuzzylite must be built first as a static library.

Uses polling data from Ipsos MORI's monthly Issues Index and general election results re-configured from ElectoralCalculus.co.uk
